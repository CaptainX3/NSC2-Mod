**HOW TO MANUALLY INSTALL NSC2**

Here are the instructions on how to manually install NSC2 from the zip file provided below. DO NOT DO THIS if you are subscribed to the mod on the Steam Workshop - this download is only for those who cannot use the Steam workshop or don't want to.

Before you begin, please take note of the following things:

> Installing a mod manually for Stellaris requires some basic PC knowledge, such as how to navigate to specific directories in Windows Explorer and opening/editing text files. If you do not know how to do these things, PLEASE subscribe to the mod on the Steam workshop, as it is extremely difficult to explain how to do these basic things in a Discord text channel if you are not familiar with computers in general.

> Keep in mind that if you manually install NSC2, you will have to repeat this process EVERY TIME NSC2 has an update if you want to always have the latest version of the mod. This manual installation will not automatically change or update itself in any way.
