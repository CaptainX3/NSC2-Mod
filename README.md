**HOW TO MANUALLY INSTALL NSC2**

Here are the instructions on how to manually install NSC2 from the zip file provided below. DO NOT DO THIS if you are subscribed to the mod on the Steam Workshop - this download is only for those who cannot use the Steam workshop or don't want to.

Before you begin, please take note of the following things:

> Installing a mod manually for Stellaris requires some basic PC knowledge, such as how to navigate to specific directories in Windows Explorer and opening/editing text files. If you do not know how to do these things, PLEASE subscribe to the mod on the Steam workshop, as it is extremely difficult to explain how to do these basic things in an online chat if you are not familiar with computers in general.

> Keep in mind that if you manually install NSC2, you will have to repeat this process EVERY TIME NSC2 has an update if you want to always have the latest version of the mod. This manual installation will not automatically change or update itself in any way.

**If you're installing NSC2 for the very first time, follow these steps:**<br />
_(If you're updating your manually-installed copy of the mod, scroll down to that section below.)_

> STEP 1: Download the NSC2 zip file from the Releases section on this site. (You should be able to see the latest release on the right hand side of the main page.)

> STEP 2: On your PC, navigate to the **Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod** folder. If this folder does not exist, you'll need to create it.

> STEP 3: Create a folder called **newshipclasses2** in this directory.

> STEP 4: Open the NSC2 zip file and extract its contents __EXACTLY AS THEY ARE__ into the folder you just created. If you've done this correctly, you should see all of the NSC2 folders in the directory now along with a descriptor.mod file.

> STEP 5: Open the **descriptor.mod** file with any text editor. In this file, look for the line that starts with **path=** and you'll see a long directory address. You need to replace the **timdg** part with whatever your PC user name is, so that it points to where the NSC2 mod folder is.

> STEP 6: Once you've done that, right click on the **descriptor.mod** file and select **Copy**. Go back up to the main **mod** folder and paste that file here. Once you've done that, rename the file to **newshipclasses2**.

> STEP 7: Open the Stellaris launcher and click on **Playsets** in the left hand menu. This should open your default mod playset. Click the "Add More Mods" button in the upper right corner and select the check box next to the **(-NSC2 Season 7 Manual Install-)** mod. Click the **Add 1 to Playset** button in the lower left of the window. Once the window closes, double check and make sure that the green Enabled button is activated next to the mod.

> STEP 8: Make sure your mod load order is correct before you start the game!! If you need help with your load order, simply type "Fix Load Order" in the #the-flagship-bot channel on this Discord and the bot will post instructions on how to sort your mods.

> STEP 9: Enjoy!

> STEP 2: On your PC, navigate to the **Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod\newshipclasses2** folder.

> STEP 3: Delete EVERYTHING you see in this folder, it needs to be __completely empty__. DO NOT extract the zip file and overwrite files, as this can break your game if we made major file changes or deleted old files!

> STEP 4: Open the NSC2 zip file and extract its contents __EXACTLY AS THEY ARE__ into the folder. If you've done this correctly, you should see all of the NSC2 folders in the directory now along with a descriptor.mod file.

> STEP 7: Open the Stellaris launcher and verify that NSC2 is still part of your playset. If it is not, you'll have to add it back in.

> STEP 8: Make sure your mod load order is correct before you start the game!! If you need help with your load order, simply type "Fix Load Order" in the #the-flagship-bot channel on this Discord and the bot will post instructions on how to sort your mods.
